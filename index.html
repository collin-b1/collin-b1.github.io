        <p>
          I have begun revamping this site to look a little bit better. Before,
          it was just a plain white page with some text. Now, it is beautiful
          and elegant, and strikes awe and amazement into the eyes of those
          lucky enough to view it. It also features a wonderful news section,
          which you are currently reading. If you can't tell, I am currently
          trying to fill space to see how the words wrap and align on larger
          screens. Please do not be alarmed by this wall of text.
